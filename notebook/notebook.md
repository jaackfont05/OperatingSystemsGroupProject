**Workload files, shared config, and Monte Carlo skeleton

Date 10/26/2026
Author Dakota Hernandez
Milestone 2: Sequential and Shared-Memory Baselines
| Type | Design decision / Contribution |

**What happened or what we did**
Set up the code structure so every workload can be called from main the same way

**Details** 

- Added a folder, header, and source file for each workload (loop, dot, monte).
- Added the config struct and getconfig / printconfig in main so every workload
  reads the same input fields (WORKLOAD, MODE, SIZE, THREADS, PROCESSES, SCHEDULE,
  CHUNK, SEED, REPETITIONS).
- Started the MonteCarlo class. It takes the config so then each workload 
gets the whole config instead of separate arguments, so all
  workloads and models are called the same way.

**Result or outcome**
The structure is done. The models aren't written yet.


**Shared constants.h and run in main

Date 10/27/2026
Author Dakota Hernandez
Milestone 2: Sequential and Shared-Memory Baselines
| Type | Design decision / Bug / Fix / Contribution |

**What happened or what we did**
Moved the shared structs into contants.h and finished run so main runs the
selected workload, I had constants in a parent folder on accident.

**Details** 

- Moved config, output, getconfig, printconfig, and printoutput into
  constants.h in the repo folder so all workloads share them.
- Added constants for the workloads (LOOP, DOT, PI), the modes (SEQUENTIAL, STD_THREAD,
  OPENMP, MPI, COMPARE, TRACE), and the schedules (STATIC, CYCLIC, DYNAMIC).
- run in main calls MonteCarlo(config).run() when WORKLOAD is PI, then fills in the
  fields every workload reports the same way (workload, mode, size, workers, schedule,
  repetitions). main prints the result with printoutput.
-MonteCarlo picks the model from MODE, runs it REPETITIONS times, and times
  each run with chrono to report the average, best, and worst time
  in ms.
- Bug: the build failed with duplicate symbols for getconfig, printconfig, and
  printoutput, because both main.cpp and monte.cpp include constants.h, which
  defines those functions.
- Fix: marked the three functions inline so it would build.

**Result or outcome**
A PI run prints the config and a full report. RESULT is 0.0 until the model functions
are written.


**Shared headers, constants.cpp, and include guards

Date 10/28/2026
Author Dakota Hernandez
Milestone 2: Sequential and Shared-Memory Baselines
| Type | Bug / Fix / Design decision |

**What happened or what we did**
Gave loop.h and dot.h the same baseline as monte.h so all three workloads are
called the same way, and fixed the duplicate symbol bug from 10/27 properly.

**Details** 

- loop.h and dot.h now follow the same layout as monte.h (a class that takes the
  config and has a run method).
- Bug from 10/27: the duplicate symbols for getconfig, printconfig, and printoutput
  were only hidden by marking them inline.
- Fix: moved the definitions into constants.cpp and left only the declarations in
  constants.h, so the inline is gone. Added include guards to constants.h and added
  constants.cpp to CMakeLists.txt.
- main now calls the other workloads (LOOP and DOT) as well as PI.

**Result or outcome**
Builds without inline. 
**Monte Carlo sequential baseline

Date 10/30/2026
Author Dakota Hernandez
Milestone 2: Sequential and Shared-Memory Baselines
| Type | Contribution |

**What happened or what we did**
Wrote sequentialEstimate for the Monte Carlo workload, the baseline the other models
get compared against.

**Details** 

- Seeds the generator with SEED, then for SIZE samples picks a random x and y
  between 0 and 1 and counts the points where x*x + y*y <= 1.
- Estimate of pi = 4 * inside / SIZE.

**Result or outcome**
SEQUENTIAL mode returns an estimate of pi and the timings.


**Switched to mt19937

Date 11/02/2026
Author Dakota Hernandez
Milestone 2: Sequential and Shared-Memory Baselines
| Type | Design decision / Fix |

**What happened or what we did**
Replaced rand with std::mt19937 in the sequential version before writing the thread
version.

**Details** 

- rand keeps hidden global state, so threads would share one sequence and the
  results would not be reproducible.
- mt19937 is not thread safe either if one generator is shared, but each thread can
  own its own, seeded with SEED + thread id.
- The sequential version now creates a local mt19937 and a uniform_real_distribution
  between 0 and 1, this also removes the need for dividing by max size :)

**Result or outcome**
Decision: every model uses mt19937 with its own generator per worker. The estimate
for a given seed changes from the rand version.


**Monte Carlo std::thread implementation

Date 11/04/2026
Author Dakota Hernandez
Milestone 2: Sequential and Shared-Memory Baselines
| Type | Design decision / Contribution / Test (pass) |

**What happened or what we did**
Wrote threadEstimate for the Monte Carlo workload.

**Details** 

- SIZE is split into THREADS blocks. The first SIZE % THREADS threads get one extra
  sample.
- Each thread runs threadWorker with its own mt19937 seeded with SEED + id and counts
  its own hits.
- Critical section: each thread writes only its own slot of the inside vector, so no
  two threads touch the same element and no lock is needed. The main thread adds the
  slots after join, so there is no race.


**Result or outcome**
STD_THREAD mode works. The result differs a little from sequential because the random
numbers come from different generators.


**Input validation in getconfig

Date 11/05/2026
Author Dakota Hernandez
Milestone 2: Sequential and Shared-Memory Baselines
| Type | Design decision / Contribution |

**What happened or what we did**
Made getconfig reject bad input instead of reading whatever was there.

**Result or outcome**
Bad or missing input no longer runs with garbage values.


**Monte Carlo OpenMP implementation

Date 11/06/2026
Author Dakota Hernandez
Milestone 2: Sequential and Shared-Memory Baselines
| Type | Design decision / Contribution / Test (pass) |

**What happened or what we did**
Wrote OPENMPestimate for the Monte Carlo workload and added OpenMP to CMake.

**Details** 

- One parallel region with num_threads(THREADS) and an omp for over the samples.
- Each thread makes its own mt19937 seeded with SEED + thread number.

**Result or outcome**
OPENMP mode works. MPI is still not written.


**Monte Carlo validation tables

Date 11/06/2026
Author Dakota Hernandez
Milestone 2: Sequential and Shared-Memory Baselines
| Type | Test / Timing result |

**What happened or what we did**
Ran the three finished Monte Carlo versions sequential, std::thread, OpenMP over a
range of sizes and thread counts and recorded the results in validation.md in the
Workload 3 folder.

**Details** 

- Sizes: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16000, 32000,
  64000, 128000, 256000, 500000, 1000000, 2000000, 5000000, 10000000.
- Threads: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 for std::thread and OpenMP. Sequential only has 1.
- Setup: SEED 12345, REPETITIONS 5, SCHEDULE STATIC, CHUNK 1000, PROCESSES 1.
- Machine: Apple M5, 10 logical cores, macOS, built with clang++ -O2.
- Each row records the RESULT and the average, best, and worst time in ms.


**Result or outcome**
monte carlo basic validation done.


## DOT Sequential and OpenMP Implementation

Date 11/08/2026
Author Chase Caldwell
Milestone 2: Sequential and Shared-Memory Baselines

**What happened or what we did**

Implemented the sequential and OpenMP versions of the DOT workload and tested them against each other to verify correctness and performance.

**Details**

- Replaced the original sequentialEstimate function, which still contained Monte Carlo Pi code, with the correct dot-product calculation.
- Added deterministic `dotA()` and `dotB()` functions that generate the same input values based on the index and seed.
- Implemented `OPENMPestimate()` using a parallel for loop with reduction to combine partial sums without race conditions.
- Added STATIC, CYCLIC, and DYNAMIC scheduling support.
- Added basic validation by comparing the OpenMP result against the sequential result.
- Fixed the sequential worker count, which was incorrectly reporting the configured thread count instead of 1.
- Had trouble compiling OpenMP using AppleClang on macOS. Switched to Homebrew LLVM and Ninja.
- Fixed a compilation error caused by a missing chrono header.
- Resolved a Git merge conflict in dot.h and merged the changes into the repository's main branch.

**Testing**

- Tested with SIZE 1000, THREADS 4, SEED 12345, and REPETITIONS 3.
- Sequential and OpenMP returned 30000 with VALID: YES.
- STATIC, CYCLIC, and DYNAMIC scheduling all returned the correct result.
- Tested with SIZE 1000000, THREADS 4, SCHEDULE STATIC, and REPETITIONS 5.
- OpenMP achieved approximately 3.05x speedup with four threads.
- Parallel efficiency was approximately 76.3%.
- OpenMP performed worse on the smaller workload because thread and scheduling overhead was significant compared to the amount of computation.

**Result or outcome**

Sequential DOT and OpenMP DOT are working and produce matching results. All three OpenMP scheduling methods passed the basic correctness tests. Changes were committed and merged into the fork's main branch for integration with Owen's std::thread implementation.
## DOT Threaded Implementation
Date 11/08/2026
Author: Owen Chipman
Workflow: STD_THREAD implementation for dot product.

**what was accomplished:**
integrated the threaded workflow with the existing code provided by chase.
Created a thread worker function that accepted threads for all three workflows, branching on each schedule type.

**testing:**
tested all three schedule types with various sizes, including sizes that did not divide easily by chunk size. all results came back valid.

**result:** the dot product workflow now has 2 of the three required workflows functional and all changes are integrated into the overarching codebase.

**LOOP std::thread design

Date 11/5/2026
Author Jonah Beck
Milestone 2: Sequential and Shared-Memory Baselines
| Type | Design decision / Pseudocode |

**What happened or what we did**
- Each thread writes its own indices and its own partial[k], so no mutex is needed.
-   STATIC: thread k gets block [k*ceil(n/t), (k+1)*ceil(n/t))
-   CYCLIC: thread k gets chunks k, k+t, k+2t, ...
-   DYNAMIC: threads grab the next chunk from an atomic counter (fetch_add) join all threads, then ad up partial[]

**Result or outcome**
Implemented in threadEstimate().
